# contouring-rectangles

## Project overview
This project aims to generate the contour of a set of rectangles, either provided by the user or randomly generated. The rectangles can overlap or be distinct, and the program will compute their combined outer boundary (contour). At the same time, it will provide a visual representation of input and output, with the use of `matplotlib` library for `python`.
Potential use cases include visualizing the boundaries of overlapping objects in graphical applications, analyzing spatial coverage in areas such as urban planning, and collision detection in game development.
